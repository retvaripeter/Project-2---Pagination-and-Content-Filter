# Project 2 - Pagination and Content Filter

Our goal is: make it easier for the user to find information and read the page with PAGINATION.

I have to keep in mind the PE:

The index.html file should display the entire list of students if JavaScript the JavaScript is unavailable or disabled for whatever reason.
Should work with every browser.

Unobstrusive JavaScript:

This means that any content or functionality related to JavaScript should be added programmatically by JavaScript. For this project, that means, the pagination buttons and the (optional) search shouldn't be added directly to the index.html file. You need to use JavaScript to add them.

FOR MORE DEATAILS PLEASE SEE THE COMMENT IN THE JS. FILE.
